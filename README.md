# Artifact accompanying "Gradual Grammars: Syntax In Levels and Locales"

## Setting up the artifact

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- From the extensions pane, install [Rascal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=UseTheSource.rascalmpl). Note, you don't need the link, just search for "Rascal" in the market place from within VS Code.

- Clone the `gradual-grammars` Github repository [https://github.com/cwi-swat/gradual-grammars](https://github.com/cwi-swat/gradual-grammars)

- From the File menu in VS Code, select "Add folder to workspace", and select the folder where you've cloned the Github repo.

- Go to the the file `src/ArtifactSLE22.rsc` and open it. If all is well, a link should occur above the first line of the module, "Import in new Rascal terminal". Click the link.

- In the just started terminal (bottom of the screen), enter the following snippet of code `setup()` (with enter). You should now be good to go to evaluate the artifact.

## Fabric

The working of Fabric can be explored by opening the files with the extension "gradgram".
